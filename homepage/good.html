               Hello! Thanks for taking a look at my little web-page. I've already got a couple out there, so I'd like to mess around with some CSS stuff here. That's a lot of my personality, really. I like to mess around with things and push the boundaries so that when push comes to shove, I have a few tricks in my bag that might apply. If this was to make it out to the wild, I suppose you'd probably like to know what exactly it is that I do. I make games! It's how I've funded my university education; making people's ideas come to life and praying that they can get additional funding based on my prototypes. Sometimes it works out, sometimes it doesn't, but I can always promise one thing: if we've agreed on a timeline and terms, I always deliver on-time, on-budget, and on-spec.

            <h2>Collected Wisdom</h2>
            <p>
               I've worked on a number of professional game projects in the Unity engine since 2015. My primary expertise lies with programming, and I've programmed pretty much every part of a game except for writing the engine itself: engine tools, AI, game systems, audio delivery, UI scripting, networking - I've done it all at various times on various projects. On top of that, I have enough experience in a few other areas to be more than capable. Audio production is a strong highlight, but I also know enough about art and design to remix elements in-engine or correct technical mistakes that artists make to improve the in-game results.

            <h2>How I Can Help</h2>
            <p>
               The layers of understanding I bring to the table allow me to be a versatile member of any team. More than that, I'm fully capable of producing prototypes without a team to back me. My biggest weakness is that I'm not capable of producing high-quality custom art and audio assets; I make up for this by bringing a large library of professional PBR materials, sound effects, and music to the table that can be remixed into the kind of low-budget prototype that could lead to further funding.
